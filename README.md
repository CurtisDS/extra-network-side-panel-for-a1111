# Add Extra Networks As A Side Panel

You can use this extension without affecting anything in the webui. It only adds an option to toggle the extra networks to be displayed on the right side of the screen.

**Note**: This uses Javascript to traverse the UI so if you have extensions that drastically alter the UI already it may not work as intended.

Below the `Generate` button there will be a new button to `Toggle Extra Networks`

After clicking this button you will see the extra network tabs on the right of your screen and the normal generation settings on the left. Click the toggle button again to return the UI to normal.
